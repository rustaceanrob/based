# Based Bot

WARNING: this bot is currently not based because it runs on OpenAI's GPT (very woke to the point it is not helpful). I am waiting for the Grok API to drop. Until then, the bot can still do a lot of helpful things for your discord: like get sports scores and betting odds, tell you about apex maps, and more stuff.
